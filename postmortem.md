# Assignment 2 Postmortem

## How difficult was this assignment?
I found it to be pretty difficult. Many hours of fiddling around with CSS.


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
Yes. Everything that I did on this assignment was new to me.


## Did you use any of the links provided in the homework? If so, which ones?
Yes. I used the one about before and after selectors.


## How could this assignment be improved?
Well, I think had I been able to attend class it would've been easier. It was just
a decent learning curves solely going off your powerpoint and Google.


## Any other comments?
Hopefully you don't grade too hard, because I know my CSS isn't the prettiest
thing ever and I'm not sure if I did all the features correctly.
